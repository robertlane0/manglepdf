# ManglePDF — Plan

> The authoritative specification is [`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md); the definition of done is
> [`FINISH.md`](FINISH.md). This file is the *working* plan: what is being built right
> now, in what order, and why. Keep it short. Living status lives in
> [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md); architectural decisions live in `docs/decisions/`.

## Shape of the work

The product is one vertical spine plus breadth:

```
spine:  open → parse (lossless) → render → select → edit → save → reopen elsewhere
```

Everything else (annotations, forms, pages, protect, export) hangs off the spine.
The spine is where the architecture is decided, so it is built first and deeply.

## Key architectural bets (see `docs/decisions/`)

| # | Bet | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-0001 | Lossless COS layer: every object kept verbatim (raw stream bytes, original `/Filter` chain), lazily resolved from file bytes via xref; edits live in an object-level copy-on-write overlay | Enables byte-for-byte preservation of everything we do not touch (Charter §4.1 law 1) and incremental saves (FINISH S1.17) |
| ADR-0002 | Content streams are parsed into a token/operator stream that **retains byte spans**; the page-object model maps every object back to its provenance ranges | Makes surgical write-back, the Inspector, and "what changed" diffing possible |
| ADR-0003 | In-house Flate **inflate** (must return partial output for truncated streams) and in-house deflate | `flate2`/`miniz_oxide` abort on corruption; a bomb must return partial data, not fail |
| ADR-0004 | egui + eframe (winit) for the GUI, everything custom-painted from design tokens | Pure Rust, no toolkit look to fight, easy canvas, HiDPI, IME, and accessibility via AccessKit |
| ADR-0005 | `ttf-parser` + `rustybuzz` for shaping only; all PDF font program handling (CFF, Type 1, subsetting, CMaps, encodings) in-house | Shaping is not PDF-shaped; font *program* handling is (Charter §2.3) |
| ADR-0006 | Permitted codecs only for JPEG (DCT) decode/encode; PNG is in-house on top of our own Flate | PNG needs exact control of predictors/bit depths; JPEG is too large to justify rewriting twice |
| ADR-0007 | Own analytic-coverage scanline rasterizer shared by PDF rendering *and* SVG icon rendering | One rasterizer to get right; dogfoods the renderer (Charter §8.7) |

## Immediate queue

1. **Settle the text scale and then draw glyph outlines** (F19–F21). The placements and the
   advance currently disagree by a factor of the font size, and until that is resolved
   nothing can be drawn correctly. Then TrueType outlines, then CFF and Type 1.
2. **A real clip region** rather than the clip path's bounding box. The renderer is where it
   belongs: the interpreter's job is to say what was clipped.
3. **Patterns**: the tiling loop and the colour-space converter, for the painting and
   shading pattern types.
4. **JBIG2 and JPEG 2000 decoders** (F17, F18), or an explicit scope statement if they are
   not going to be built.
5. **Fill the Inspector's right-hand region** from the object model, which is the window work
   that has not been started.
6. Tier-A fixtures for the remaining catalogue entries, then Tier B with `SOURCES.md`.

Settled and no longer queued: images decode and draw, axial and radial shadings paint, the
clip bounds are transformed by exactly one matrix, and the standard-14 width tables are
verified rather than trusted — every one of the 1043 widths was measured against two
independent renderers and Adobe's own metrics, so nobody should re-derive them from a local
URW clone.
